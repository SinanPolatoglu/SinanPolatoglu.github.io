Hello there! I am Sinan, a **people analytics data scientist** at Deloitte. This is my personal page, where I intend to share thoughts & ideas on topics related to data science.

My experience situates mostly in (big) data transformation, visualisation and modelling. I have experience in **statistics** and **machine learning** applied in a business context. For this, I use tools such as **R** and **Python**.

I started my education in social sciences, with a study in industrial-organizational psychology at Ghent University. During this period, I developed a passion for data-driven decision-making in HR. To further develop my skills in data science, I pursued an advanced master's degree in computational statistics.

In September 2019 I joined Deloite's people analytics team where I currently work on HR problems. Check out my testimonial video below!
